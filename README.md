## FIPS compatible LibZ
This is a fork of the [LibZ library](https://github.com/MiloszKrajewski/LibZ) that is compatible with [FIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards). FIPS does not allow the MD5 algorithm hash to be run. LibZ uses that algorithm to identify assemblies it injects into the assembly as resources. This fork changes the algorithm to SHA-1. See the original library for installation and usage.
